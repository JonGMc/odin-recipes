    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a delicious and simple recipe to make a sumptious and filling vegan risotto.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>bulb fennel, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 courgette, halved lengthways and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>tsp fennel seeds, lightly crushed</li>
        <li>200g risotto rice</li>
        <li>a small glass vegan white wine (optional)</li>
        <li>800ml vegetable stock, hot</li>
        <li>200g frozen peas</li>
        <li>2 tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large, deep frying pan, add the onion,<br>
            fennel and courgette, and fry for 10 minutes until softened, adding<br>
            a splash of water if it starts to catch. Add the garlic and fennel seeds,<br>
            and cook for 2 minutes, then add the rice and stir until every grain is lightly<br> 
            coated in oil. Pour in the wine, if using, and bubble away until reduced by half.</li>
        <li>Keep the vegetable stock in a pan over a very low heat to keep warm. Add a ladleful<br>
            at a time to the risotto, only adding more once the last spoonful has been completely absorbed,<br>
            stirring all the time. Once the rice is cooked but still has a little bite, add the frozen peas<br>
            and cook for another few minutes until just cooked. Stir in the nutritional yeast, lemon zest<br>
            and juice, and some seasoning, divide between shallow bowls and top with the parsley.</li>
